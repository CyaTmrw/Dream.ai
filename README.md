Our project is a text and image generation tool that uses machine learning to create stories from prompts given by the user. The user can input a prompt, and the tool will generate a story with corresponding text and images. The user can also specify certain attributes such as characters, settings, and emotions to influence the story's outcome. Additionally, the tool allows users to export the generated story as a downloadable book in the PDF format. The goal of this project is to make story-telling interactive and fun for users.
